This project is entirely based on the following projects: ngravs and Gadget2-static_potential, 
who inspired the combination of the two very impressive projects.

The first is called Ngrav by Kevin Arthur and Schiff Croker, which can be found in the following Repository: https://github.com/kcroker/Gadget-2.0.7-ngravs.git

This code implements an extension of the N-body code GADGET-2 by Volker Springel to enable computation with D distinct interacting gravitational species.

The second is called Gadget2-static_potential by Giuliano, which can be found in the following Repository: https://github.com/giulianoiorio/Gadget2-static_potential.git

A Gadget-2 code with the addition of the static potential.
